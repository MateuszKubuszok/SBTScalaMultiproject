# SBT Scala multiproject template

![https://travis-ci.org/MateuszKubuszok/SBTScalaMultiproject](https://travis-ci.org/MateuszKubuszok/SBTScalaMultiproject.svg)

*Notice: I've migrated to Gitter8 template with several fixes/improvements over the old one - see [here](https://github.com/MateuszKubuszok/SBTScalaMultiproject2.g8).*

Template of SBT Scala with:

 * two modules independent of each other: `first` and `second`,
 * one `common` project - used by both `first` and `second`,
 * [Scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform) configuration,
 * [Scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) configuration,
 * [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/) configuration,
 * predefined [sub]tasks: `integration:test`, `functional:test`, `unit:test` which run tests tagged as
   `IntegrationTest`/`FunctionalTest`/`UnitTest` respectively,
 * filtering out tests tagged as `DisabledTest`.

## Customization

Start with changing module namespace to your own both inside Scala files as well as in `project/Settings.scala`. Make
sure to update initial command if you want to run `console` task of SBT. Update organization name and version number.

Within `build.sbt` use existing modules as basis how to use small DSL for applying common settings:

 * `project.from("name")` will create module from `modules/name` directory and set its SBT name to `name`,
 * `setName("name")` and `setDescription("description")` can be used for settings up artifact name and description with
   fluent interface,
 * `setInitialCommand("command")` will set console starting point to `your.namespace.{command}`,
 * `configureModule` will apply all common settings from `Settings.scala`,
 * `configureUnitTests`/`configureFunctionalTests`/`configureIntegrationTests` will add `unit:test`/`functional:test`/
   `integration:test` task to your module,
 * `dependsOnProjects(projects)` will set up both compile and test dependency (so tests will succeed only if module's
    own and it's dependency's tests will pass, and in test code you could use some common code from your dependencies),
 * each of those commands will return project allowing normal `.settings(settings)` application. For individual settings
   one can also use `modules/name/build.sbt` individual per-module settings.

You should also take a closer look at `project/Settings.scala` for tweaking `scalacOptions`,
`ScalariformKeys.preferences` and `scalastyle-config.xml` for defining defaults best suiting your project.

Last but not least, edit common resolvers and dependencies within `project/Dependencies.scala`

After understanding how template works you are encourage to remove `activator.properties`, `tutorial/index.html` and
providing your own `README` and `LICENSE` files.

## Overriding defaults checks

If possible make defaults as strict as possible and just loosen them where absolutely needed:

 * coverage disabling:

   ```scala
   // $COVERAGE:OFF$ [reason]
   // not measured 
   // $COVERAGE:ON$
   ```
 * formatting disabling:

   ```scala
   // format: OFF
   // not formatted
   // format: ON
   ```
 * style check disabling:

   ```scala
   // scalastyle:off [rule id]
   // not checked
   // scalastyle:on
   ```

It can be used for e.g disabling measurement of automatically generated code, formatting that merges lines into
something exceeding character limit or allowing null where interacting with Java code.

## Running main classes:

```bash
sbt "project first" run // or
sbt first/run

sbt "project second" run // or
sbt second/run
```

## Tests

### Running all tests with coverage and style check:

```bash
sbt clean coverage test coverageReport coverageAggregate scalastyle
```

If you measure coverage you have to clean project otherwise it will not instrument properly. (To be precise coverage
cache should be clean if you want to have correct results - if you have just built project and haven't run any tests
with coverage enabled you don't have to clean anything).

### Selecting test suites

Running selected suite:

```bash
sbt first/test
sbt first/unit:test
sbt first/unit:functional
sbt first/unit:integration
sbt second/test
sbt second/unit:test
sbt second/unit:functional
sbt second/unit:integration
```

### Creating tagged test:

```scala
class ClassUnderTestSpec extends Specification with Mockito {

  "ClassUnderTest" should {

    "be nice here" in {
      // given
      ...

      // when
      ...

      // then
      ...
    } tag UnitTest
    
    "be nice overall" in {
      // given
      ...

      // when
      ...

      // then
      ...
    } tag FunctionalTest
  }
  
}
```

### Test tags

Tags are defined in `TestTag` object. One can define its own tags by adding them into `TestTag` objects (both in build
as well as in commons) and then creating task and implicit class using existing tasks configs as example.

E.g. if one were to add hic own tag:

```
object TestTag {
  ...
  val CustomTest = "custom"
}
```

in both objects, then added:

```scala
object Settings {
  private val customTestTag = TestTag.CustomTest
  val CustomTest = config(customTestTag) extend Test describedAs "Runs only custom tests"
  
  ...
  
  implicit class CustomTestConfigurator(project: Project)
    extends Configurator(project, CustomTest, customTestTag) {

    def configureCustomTests: Project = configure
  }
}
```

to `project/Settings.scala` and finally:

```
val myProject.from("my-project")
  ...
  .configureCustomTests
```

then he/she would be able to run:

```bash
sbt my-project/custom:test
```

task running only tests tagged as `CustomTest`.
